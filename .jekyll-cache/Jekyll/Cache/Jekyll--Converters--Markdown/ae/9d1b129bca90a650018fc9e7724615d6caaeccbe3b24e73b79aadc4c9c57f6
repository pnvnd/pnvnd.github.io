<p>Pihole runs great on a Raspberry Pi, but what about other devices?  If you have a server lying around that can run Docker, Pihole will work.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Pihole was created to run on Rasbperry Pi devices, but this shouldnâ€™t be limited to device.  There is an official Docker image that can be used on any device that can run Docker.  The only caveat is that youâ€™ll need to manually update the container when a new version comes out.  Luckily, the following guide will show you how to do it with a script.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>Make sure you have a device capabile of running Docker first.</p>
