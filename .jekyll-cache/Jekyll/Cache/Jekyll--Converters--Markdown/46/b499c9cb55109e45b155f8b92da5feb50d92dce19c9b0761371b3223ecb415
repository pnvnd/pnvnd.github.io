<p>A number is divisible by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 if it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8</li>
  <li>3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3</li>
  <li>4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4</li>
  <li>5 if the number ends in 0 or 5</li>
  <li>6 if the number us divisible by 2 and 3</li>
  <li>8 if the last three digits are divisible by 8</li>
  <li>9 if the sum of the digits are divisible by 9</li>
  <li>10 if the numbber ends in 0</li>
</ul>

<p>To check divisibility for a positive number with Python, try this function:  It checks the input number and performs the modulus operation to see if itâ€™s 0.  If there is no remainder, it is divisible by that number.<br />
